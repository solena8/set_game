# Set Game Solver

Welcome to the Set Game Solver repository! This project is a tool designed to assist players of the card game **Set** by identifying possible sets of cards based on the game's rules.

## About the Game

**Set** is a visual perception game where players must find sets of three cards from a selection. Each card is defined by four attributes: color, shape, number, and shading. A set consists of three cards where each attribute is either all the same or all different across the cards.

## Features

- **Card Selection**: Input your current selection of 12 or 15 cards from your physical game.
- **Set Identification**: The solver analyzes the cards and provides possible sets of three that meet the gameâ€™s criteria.
- **User Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript to provide an intuitive front-end experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
